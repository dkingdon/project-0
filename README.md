## Technologies
HTML, CSS, javascript, jQuery 3.1.1 CDN, Boostrap 3.3.6 CDN, jQuery UI 1.12.1 CDN

## Missed Personal Goals
* Save and display player win counts
* Add a reset button to reset the game pieces
* Add a key lock function that prevents game pieces from being moved until countdown timer completes
* Create bot functionality for one player action
* User name / callsign input

## Known Issues (bugs)
* Due to time constraints, this game only looks good on a full screen 15inch laptop screen
* Welcome dialog resizes the background
* Win dialog flickers and slightly shifts the game window
* Play button defaults to original styling in "active" mode
* HUD does not touch the bottom of the screen
* Dialog Close buttons are not properly positioned
* Timed gameplay for extra challenges
* Persistent leader board

## Thinking Ahead
* Would be cool if I could get the moves to be turn based using pop ups to ask math questions, trivia, or typing challenges. Distance moved would be dependent on time it took to complete the challenge.

* Want to create difficulty settings that would toggle the amount of times a user had to hit a key before moving forward (possible change the amount of pixels the game piece moves)

* Player choice in game pieces

* Multiple levels, possibly give the option to change background after the game is completed in a certain amount of time.
